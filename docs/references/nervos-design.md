Here is a collection of all the materials that can help you to understand the design philosophy of Nervos CKB in deep.

## Papers

These are all the important papers the illustrate the design of CKB.

- [Nervos CKB White Paper](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0002-ckb/0002-ckb.md)
- [CKB-VM Paper](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/tree/master/rfcs/0003-ckb-vm)
- [Token Economic Paper](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0015-ckb-cryptoeconomics/0015-ckb-cryptoeconomics.md)

## RFCs

Nervos is initiated to be a community driven project. It uses a request for comment process for the community to propose changes to the Nervos protocol. In [Nervos RFCs repo](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs) you can find all the related information and the existing RFCs.
